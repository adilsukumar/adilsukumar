## Hey, I’m Adil Sukumar👋

I get curious about stuff and accidentally end up deep in projects.  
Sometimes it's building a robot, sometimes it's learning something random just because i *had* to know how it works.

I like figuring things out for fun — not because someone told me to, but because i love that “wait... no way” moment.  
I jump between interests a lot, but when something clicks with me, it gets all my focus.

### Some facts that probably say more than a bio ever could:
- I’m not great at sitting still — mentally or physically  
- My curiosity has no chill  
- I’ve taught myself a bunch of stuff just because i was bored  
- If something breaks, i *have* to try fixing it (even if i’m the one who broke it)  
- I love learning by doing — failing is part of the fun  
- I kind of live on “what if…?” energy  
- I like mixing tech with a bit of chaos, humor, and heart

### Not just what i do — but *how* i do things:
I tend to figure things out by throwing myself into them. i read, i test, i break, i retry.  
I like making things feel personal — whether it’s code, robots, apps, or just ideas.  
I ask a lot of questions, not always to find answers, but to see where the questions lead.

### If you’ve read this far:
You probably get the vibe.  
I'm not trying to be the smartest person in the room — just the most curious one.
