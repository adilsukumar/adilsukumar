## Hey, I’m Adil 👋

i get curious about stuff and accidentally end up deep in projects.  
sometimes it's building a robot, sometimes it's learning something random just because i *had* to know how it works.

i like figuring things out for fun — not because someone told me to, but because i love that “wait... no way” moment.  
i jump between interests a lot, but when something clicks with me, it gets all my focus.

### some facts that probably say more than a bio ever could:
- i’m not great at sitting still — mentally or physically  
- my curiosity has no chill  
- i’ve taught myself a bunch of stuff just because i was bored  
- if something breaks, i *have* to try fixing it (even if i’m the one who broke it)  
- i love learning by doing — failing is part of the fun  
- i kind of live on “what if…?” energy  
- i like mixing tech with a bit of chaos, humor, and heart

### not just what i do — but *how* i do things:
i tend to figure things out by throwing myself into them. i read, i test, i break, i retry.  
i like making things feel personal — whether it’s code, robots, apps, or just ideas.  
i ask a lot of questions, not always to find answers, but to see where the questions lead.

### if you’ve read this far:
you probably get the vibe.  
i'm not trying to be the smartest person in the room — just the most curious one.

wanna talk? build? share cool ideas?
